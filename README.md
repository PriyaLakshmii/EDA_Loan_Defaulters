# EDA_Loan_Defaulters

## Project Description:
This project is an exploratory data analysis of loan defaulters. The aim is to identify the factors that contribute to loan default and to understand the underlying patterns and trends. The data used in the analysis is obtained from a loan default dataset. The analysis is performed using Python and its various libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

This case study is a real business scenario of risk analytics in banking and financial services.The Objective of this case study is to identify loan defaulters and therefore reduce the risk of losing money to defaulters using 
Exploratory Data Analysis.

We will use EDA to identify patterns and segregate defaulters and non-defaulters

In other words, the company wants to understand the factors behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its risk assessment.

## EDA Steps:
1. Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset

2. Checking missing values and Outliers

3. Data cleaning and preparation

4. Creating visual methods to analyze the data

5. Analyzing trends, patterns, and relationships in the Data
